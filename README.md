#  The MoonDevs Startup Assignment


## Assignment Choices

I chose the second assignment option: Fragment the UI into selective components. This decision aimed to improve maintainability and readability.

##  ⚙️ My Reasons for Fragmentating

##### Enhanced Readability: Breaking down the UI into components significantly improves the code's readability. Each component serves a specific purpose, making it easier for developers to understand and navigate the codebase.

#####  Modular Codebase: The code now follows a modular structure, where each component handles a distinct functionality. This modularity promotes better organization and maintainability.

##### Scalability: The fragmented structure you've implemented lays a solid foundation for scalability. Adding or modifying features becomes more straightforward, as each component is designed to encapsulate specific behaviors.

#####  Simplified Maintenance: Your approach facilitates future maintenance tasks. With components dedicated to specific aspects of the application, making updates or fixing issues becomes more streamlined and less error-prone.

#####  Clear Separation of Concerns: By assigning specific responsibilities to each component, you've achieved a clear separation of concerns. This separation makes the codebase more manageable and contributes to a cleaner architecture.



## Before & After

Check out the `before` folder for the original code snippet and the `after` folder for the improved, fragmented version.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore the `before` and `after` folders to witness the transformation.
3. Dive into the code to see how components were selectively crafted for better readability.
